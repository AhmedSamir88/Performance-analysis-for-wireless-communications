STAR-RISs: Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces

In this letter, simultaneous transmitting and
reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) are
studied. Compared with the conventional reflecting-only RISs,
the coverage of STAR-RISs is extended to 360 degrees via simultaneous transmission and reflection. A general hardware model
for STAR-RISs is presented. Then, channel models are proposed
for the near-field and the far-field scenarios, based on which
the diversity gain of the STAR-RISs is analyzed and compared
with that of the conventional RISs. Numerical simulations are
provided to verify analytical results and to demonstrate that full
diversity order can be achieved on both sides of the STAR-RIS.
